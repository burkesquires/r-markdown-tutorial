title: "R Notebook - Mock Analysis"
author: Ann Alyzer
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Gapminder Analysis

- The [Gapminder project](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) has collected data from countries around the world that look at communication, economic, education, environment, health, infrastructure, population, society, and work in each country since the 1950s.

In this particular analysis we will be looking at the trends over time of life expectancy versus a country's gross domestic product or GDP. Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services (less imports)[1].

## Analysis Plan

1. Import data
1. Analyze data
1. Plot data
1. Draw amazing conclusions!

## Import libraries and data

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
source("bin/chunk-options.R")
knitr_fig_path("01-")
# Silently load in the data so the rest of the lesson works
gapminder <- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", header = TRUE)
```

## Preview the Gapminder data

```{r}
print(gapminder)
```

```{r lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```


```{r lifeExp-line}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line()
```


```{r lifeExp-line-point}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()
```


```{r lifeExp-layer-example-1}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country)) +

```



```{r lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter3, message=FALSE}

```{r axis-scale, fig.cap = "Scatterplot of GDP vs life expectancy showing logarithmic x-axis data spread"}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +

```



```{r lm-fit}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
```


```{r lm-fit2}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method="lm", size=1.5)
```


```{r facet}
americas <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas",]
ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```


```{r theme}

  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",              # x axis title
    y = "Life expectancy",   # y axis title
    title = "Figure 1",      # main title of figure
    color = "Continent"      # title of legend
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

```{r directory-check, echo = FALSE}
if (!dir.exists("results")) {
  dir.create("results")
}
```

```{r save}
lifeExp_plot <- ggplot(data = americas, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ country) +
  labs(
    x = "Year",              # x axis title
    y = "Life expectancy",   # y axis title
    title = "Figure 1",      # main title of figure
    color = "Continent"      # title of legend
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

ggsave(filename = "results/lifeExp.png", plot = lifeExp_plot, width = 12, height = 10, dpi = 300, units = "cm")
