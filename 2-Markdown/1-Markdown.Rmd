# What is Markdown?

- Markdown is a programming language to enable basic text files to be easily exported to (X)HTML

--
- Created in 2004 by John Gruber in collaboration with the late Aaron Swartz

--
- Emphasis is placed on **readability** - the **.md** or **.markdown** files can be read on their own

--
- Markdown is an informal specification, in 2016 groups started to make formal variants: MultiMarkdown, GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), **Pandoc**, CommonMark, etc.

# RELAX!

# Markdown

- Markdown enables you to communicate your thoughts to your collaborators and your future self,

- Combining text, documented code, even math, 

- and **no fuss**.

---

# Markdown Playground

- Lets practice some markdown!

- Open a browser window and go to: https://stackedit.io/app

- This will enable you to write teh markdown and see how it is formatted at the same time

---

# What Markdown looks like

- Please type this in the stackedit.io window

````{.markdown}
Text formatting
===============

Inline markup
-------------

**Paragraphs** begin and end 
with empty lines, and are *not* indented.

- **bold** and *emphasis*
- ~~strikeout~~
- super^scripts^ and sub~scripts~
- and `inline_code($fixed.width)`

# Lists

````{.markdown}
Lists must be preceded by an empty line,

1.  ordered or unordered.
 1.  Indenting subsequent content
    
    -  will continue the list

        *   and nest
        *   other lists.

1.  *Indenting* means one tab, or four spaces.

# Markdown Can Do Math

```
- Math goes between `$`, single ($\pi$), or double: 
$$ \frac{\pi}{4} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2k+1} .$$
```

$$\frac{\pi}{4} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2k+1} .$$

# Markdown Can Do Math

- Even math environments *inside* double dollar signs:

```{.md}
$$
\begin{align}
    x &= (a+b)^2 - (a-b)^2 \\
      &= 4ab
\end{align}
$$
```

\begin{align}
    x &= (a+b)^2 - (a-b)^2 \\
      &= 4ab
\end{align}

# Code blocks

````
```{r}
msg <- "Hello, world."
print(msg)
```
````

````{.r}
msg <- "Hello, world."
print(msg)
````


**produces**

```{r}
msg <- "Hello, world."
print(msg)
```

Setting width and height are optional.
