# What is Markdown?

- Markdown is a programming language to enable basic text files to be easily exported to (X)HTML

--
- Created in 2004 by John Gruber in collaboration with the late Aaron Swartz

--
- Emphasis is placed on **readability** - the **.md** or **.markdown** files can be read on their own

--
- Markdown is an informal specification, in 2016 groups started to make formal variants: MultiMarkdown, GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), **Pandoc**, CommonMark, etc.

# Another Programming Language???

# RELAX!

# Markdown

- Markdown enables you to communicate your thoughts to your collaborators and your future self,

- Combining text, documented code, even math, 

- and **no fuss**.


---

## Would you rather read/write this code in HTML?

```{.html}
<body>
  <section>
    <h1>Fresh Berry Salad Recipe</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Blueberries</li>
      <li>Strawberries</li>
      <li>Blackberries</li>
      <li>Raspberries</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</body>
```

Or this code in Markdown?

```{markdown}
    # Fresh Berry Salad Recipe

    * Blueberries
    * Strawberries
    * Blackberries  
    * Raspberries
```

# Markdown Playground

- Lets practice some markdown!

- Open a browser window and go to: https://stackedit.io/app

- This will enable you to write teh markdown and see how it is formatted at the same time

---

# What Markdown looks like

- Please type this in the stackedit.io window

````{.markdown}
Text formatting
===============

Inline markup
-------------

**Paragraphs** begin and end 
with empty lines, and are *not* indented.

- **bold** and *emphasis*
- ~~strikeout~~
- super^scripts^ and sub~scripts~
- and `inline_code($fixed.width)`

````

# Lists

````{.markdown}
Lists must be preceded by an empty line,

1.  ordered or unordered.
 1.  Indenting subsequent content
    
    -  will continue the list

        *   and nest
        *   other lists.

1.  *Indenting* means one tab, or four spaces.

# Exercise

This afternoon we will create a (very) simple analysis and uuse it as a model to practice some diifferent outputs from markdown.

Now lets use some knowledge of markdown to draft our mock analysis overview and the steps we will take to complete our analysis.

---

You can create your own or use the information bbelow as a model:

# Project Name

## Your Name

## Today's date

**Overview**

We want to compare the life expectancy of individuals from different countries over time to determine is life expectancy is increaseing or decreasing and what are some possible casuses. This project uses the `Gapminder` data set for some simple analysis

- The [Gapminder project](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) has collected data from countries around the world that look at communication, economic, education, environment, health, infrastructure, population, society, and work in each country.

Project Outline

1. step 1

# Markdown Can Do Math

- Math goes between `$`, single ($\pi$), or double:

```
$$ \frac{\pi}{4} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2k+1} .$$
```

$$\frac{\pi}{4} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{2k+1} .$$


---

# Markdown Can Do Math

- Even math environments *inside* double dollar signs:

```{.md}
$$
\begin{align}
    x &= (a+b)^2 - (a-b)^2 \\
      &= 4ab
\end{align}
$$
```

\begin{align}
    x &= (a+b)^2 - (a-b)^2 \\
      &= 4ab
\end{align}

# Code blocks

````
```{r}
msg <- "Hello, world."
print(msg)
```
````

````{.r}
msg <- "Hello, world."
print(msg)
````


**produces**

```{r}
msg <- "Hello, world."
print(msg)
```

Setting width and height are optional.
